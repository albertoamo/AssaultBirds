# AssaultBirds
This repository contains all the source code from the Assault Birds game that was developed by Xavi Blay & Alberto SÃ¡nchez for the Taller de juegos electronicos course from UPF.
All the source code except some libraries and some classes by our teacher (tamat) were developed by us during 3 months. 
Most of the assets are not in this project because they are ripped from other games. This is because in three months there is no chance to create our own meshes or get them from other people. To test the game, please pm me.

Also there is a preview of the final game uploaded on youtube:

The game is finished, but due to the extreme date of delivery (three months), we couldn't complete the project to the 100%.
